# MedicML
Latest machine learning innovations for Medical Imaging

This is the project repository for the Brisbane health hack 2019. The goal is to develop an interface for applying mashine learning models to medical imaging data. 

Core Feature List:
1) platform-independent GUI in Python / Electron / ?
2) Import of Dicom data
3) Applying Machine Learning models to this dicom data (example: Segmentation and Highlighting of Brain Lesions)
4) Visualising Output

Optional Feature List:
- Model zoo online with upload possibility
- Model conversion from Tensorflow, PyTorch, Caffe, Theano .... to be able to be used in our GUI
- Local Transfer Learning to adjust models to available data at the local site
